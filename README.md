# 17. Hypothesis Testing in Healthcare
Pharmaceutical drugs have become an essential part of our health. Therefore, they need to be safe with little or no adverse effects.
You work with a non-profit that advocates for pharmaceutical drug safety. One of Its tasks is to create reports on drugs independent of the drug manufacturer. You'll conduct several hypothesis tests using Python to determine if the adverse reactions of a hypothetical drug are significant. You'll also check if factors such as age significantly influence the adverse reactions. You will use the `drug_safety.csv` dataset to perform the following tasks:
1.  Determine if the proportion of adverse effects differs significantly between the Drug and Placebo groups, saving the p-value as a variable called `two_sample_p_value`.
2.  Find out if the number of adverse effects is independent of the treatment and control groups, saving as a variable called `num_effects_p_value` containing a p-value.
3.  Examine if there is a significant difference between the ages of the Drug and Placebo groups, storing the p-value of your test in a variable called `age_group_effects_p_value`.
